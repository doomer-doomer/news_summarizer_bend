We know this because paleontologists have just made a startling find: a nearly complete skull from this newly discovered hypercarnivore. It belonged to a member of the extinct order of carnivores known as Hyaenodonta.

A team led by paleontologist Shorouq Al-Ashqar of Mansoura University and the American University in Egypt has given the fearsome creature the name Bastetodon syrtos, after the Egyptian lioness-headed goddess of protection, Bastet. "For days, the team meticulously excavated layers of rock dating back around 30 million years," Al-Ashqar recalls of the dig that yielded the fossilized skull bones.

"Just as we were about to conclude our work, a team member spotted something remarkable – a set of large teeth sticking out of the ground.

His excited shout brought the team together, marking the beginning of an extraordinary discovery: a nearly complete skull of an ancient apex carnivore, a dream for any vertebrate paleontologist." The Fayum Depression, where the bones were found, represents an incredibly rich and important fossil assemblage for understanding a 15 million-year period in the history of the region, during the Paleogene, a crucial time in the rise of mammals. The Fayum Depression, where the bones were found, represents an incredibly rich and important fossil assemblage for understanding a 15 million-year period in the history of the region, during the Paleogene, a crucial time in the rise of mammals. Paleontologists have been working in the region for more than a century, uncovering the rich ecosystem that once thrived there. Paleontologists have been working in the region for more than a century, uncovering the rich ecosystem that once thrived there. "The Fayum is one of the most important fossil areas in Africa," explains paleontologist Matt Borths of Duke University in the US. "Without it, we would know very little about the origins of African ecosystems and the evolution of African mammals like elephants, primates, and hyaenodonts."

"Without it, we would know very little about the origins of African ecosystems and the evolution of African mammals like elephants, primates, and hyaenodonts." Although all bones are important for understanding the anatomy of extinct beasts, the skull is arguably the most important, revealing much about an animal\'s survival strategies. The skull of Bastetodon reveals dentition consistent with Hyaeonodonta, allowing its confident classification, as well as insights into its lifestyle.

The skull of Bastetodon reveals dentition consistent with Hyaeonodonta, allowing its confident classification, as well as insights into its lifestyle. The animal, the researchers say, was a hypercarnivore – one whose diet, much like cats (wild ones, at any rate) and crocodiles, consists of more than 70 percent meat. It would have occupied a top predator position in its local food web. The animal, the researchers say, was a hypercarnivore – one whose diet, much like cats (wild ones, at any rate) and crocodiles, consists of more than 70 percent meat. It would have occupied a top predator position in its local food web. But the discovery allowed something else – the contextualization of fossils discovered 120 years ago. These remains belonged to a group of lion-sized hyaenodonts that lived in the Fayum region millions of years ago. When they were first analyzed in 1904, they were lumped in with European hyaenodonts.

Al-Ashqar and her colleagues found that these fossils, newly grouped together under the genus Sekhmetops (for the Ancient Egyptian lioness-headed goddess of war, Sekhmet) originated in Africa in waves, and are distinct from the European hyaenodonts. Bastetodon also originated in Africa.

Bastetodon also originated in Africa. From there, the animals spread across the Northern hemisphere, making their way to Asia, Europe, India, and North America. However, their reign in Africa was curtailed by environmental changes that led to their eventual extinction, opening ecological niches for other predators to rise to prominence.

The discovery occurred during an excavation of rock layers dating back approximately 30 million years.  Al-Ashqar recounts,  \\u201cFor days, the team meticulously excavated layers of rock dating back around 30 million years...Just as we were about to conclude our work, a team member spotted something remarkable \\u2013 a set of large teeth sticking out of the ground. His excited shout brought the team together, marking the beginning of an extraordinary discovery: a nearly complete skull of an ancient apex carnivore, a dream for any vertebrate paleontologist.\\u201d\\n\\nThe newly discovered species, named *Bastetodon syrtos*, belonged to the extinct order Hyaenodonta and was a leopard-sized apex predator.  Its skull reveals dentition consistent with the Hyaenodonta order, providing insights into its lifestyle.  According to the researchers, *Bastetodon syrtos* was a hypercarnivore, with a diet consisting of more than 70 percent meat.  It occupied a top predator position within its ecosystem.\\n\\nThe Fayum Depression, where the fossil was found, is described by paleontologist Matt Borths of Duke University as \\u201cone of the most important fossil areas in Africa,\\u201d crucial for understanding the origins of African ecosystems and the evolution of African mammals.  The discovery also provided context for fossils found 120 years ago, which were initially misclassified. These fossils, now grouped under the genus *Sekhmetops*, are now understood to have originated in Africa and spread across the Northern Hemisphere to Asia, Europe, India, and North America before their eventual extinction due to environmental changes.\\n\\nAl-Ashqar states, \\"The discovery of *Bastetodon* is a significant achievement in understanding the diversity and evolution of hyaenodonts and their global distribution. We are eager to continue our research to unravel the intricate relationships between these ancient predators and their environments over time and across continents.\\u201d The research has been published in the *Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology*.\\n\\n\\n**CONCLUSION**:\\n\\nThe discovery of the nearly complete skull of *Bastetodon syrtos* in the Fayum Depression represents a significant contribution to our understanding of ancient African ecosystems and the evolution of the extinct Hyaenodonta order.  The find not only reveals a new apex predator species but also clarifies the evolutionary history and geographic distribution of related species previously misidentified.  Further research is planned to explore the relationships between these ancient predators and their environment.\\n"}\r\n\r\n'

Former Southwest spokesperson Ed Stewart highlighted the significance of the layoffs, stating, \\"For more than 50 years we had that claim to fame...it...was always people first,\\" adding, \\"That\\u2019s why it\\u2019s such a big shock right now in the industry.\\"\\n\\nWill Anderson, Editor in Chief of the Dallas Business Journal, pointed out that CEO Bob Jordan aims for $500 million in annual savings, suggesting these layoffs may not be the final cost-cutting measure.  He stated, \\"CEO Bob Jordan has said he wants to save about $500 million annually...So, this gets him part way there, but not all the way.\\"\\n\\nDallas Mayor Eric Johnson offered a statement in response to the layoffs: \\u201cI do not comment on individual business decisions, but my heart goes out to the employees who are losing jobs and to all those impacted by this period of transition. Southwest Airlines has become a dynamic and dominant airline because its leaders have made bold decisions, adapted to changing economic conditions, prioritized customer service, and provided an affordable and competitive option for travelers, including those who fly out of Dallas Love Field. We remain proud that Southwest calls Dallas home.\\u201d\\n\\n\\n**CONCLUSION**:\\n\\nSouthwest Airlines implemented its first-ever mass layoff, affecting 1,750 corporate employees in Dallas, as part of a cost-cutting initiative aiming for $500 million in annual savings.  The layoffs, while unprecedented in the company\'s 53-year history, are presented by leadership as necessary for restructuring and transforming the airline into a \\"leaner, faster, and more agile organization.\\"  The impact on the Dallas community and the airline\'s future remain to be seen.\\n"}\r\n\r\n'

The injury appeared to occur at 5:12 of the first period when Tkachuk lost his edge on a rush, crashing into Swedish goalie Samuel Ersson's leg and skate, dislodging the net.  After a brief return to the ice for a 10-second and then a 14-second shift, Tkachuk did not play for the remainder of the game.\n\nU.S. coach Mike Sullivan stated, “Brady obviously had a lower-body injury.

I haven't got an update to this point after the game yet, so we'll see how he responds, but I don't anticipate it being an issue.”  The team was already playing without Matthew Tkachuk (lower body), Auston Matthews (upper body), and Charlie McAvoy (upper body).  Sullivan commented on the other injured players, saying, “Charlie, right now he's out with an upper-body injury.

2025-02-19 22:45:30,510 [DEBUG] chunk: b'event: summary\r\ndata: {"type": "chunk", "content": "**SUMMARY**:\\n\\nNovak Djokovic, a 24-time Grand Slam singles champion, criticized the handling of recent doping cases in tennis, suggesting \\"favoritism\\" and stating that the situation is \\"not a good image for our sport.\\"  His comments follow the three-month ban imposed on world No. 1 Jannik Sinner for twice testing positive for the banned substance Clostebol in March 2024.  Initially, the International Tennis Integrity Agency (ITIA) cleared Sinner in August 2024, but the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) appealed, leading to the CAS ruling resulting in the ban.  The ban, effective February 9 to May 4, 2025, will not affect Sinner\'s participation in the French Open, according to reports.  Djokovic stated that a majority of players he\'s spoken to feel the process was unfair and that \\"there is favoritism happening,\\" adding that \\"it appears that you can almost affect the outcome if you are a top player, if you have access to the top lawyers and whatnot.\\"\\n\\nBritish tennis player Liam Broady echoed these concerns, stating to BBC Sport that the ban seemed designed to \\"impact Jannik\\u2019s career as little as possible,\\" noting the timing of the ban ending just before the Rome Masters, a major tournament in Sinner\'s home country.  Sinner himself stated that the positive tests resulted from \\"inadvertent contamination of Clostebol\\" through a physiotherapist\'s use of an over-the-counter spray.  Despite the initial clearance, Sinner subsequently won the 2024 US Open and the 2025 Australian Open.\\n\\nThe handling of Sinner\'s case, along with that of women\'s world No. 2 Iga \\u015awi\\u0105tek (who received a one-month suspension for trimetazidine), has drawn criticism.  Two-time Grand Slam champion Simona Halep, who received a four-year ban (later reduced to nine months by CAS) for Roxadustat, also criticized the differing treatment.  The ITIA responded to Halep\'s accusations by stating that it \\"deal(s) with each case based on the facts and evidence, not a player\\u2019s name, ranking or nationality.\\"  Halep subsequently retired from professional tennis.\\n\\nDjokovic further emphasized the need to address the system\'s inconsistencies, stating on Monday, \\"The inconsistency is something that frustrates all the players...Right now, there is a lack of trust generally from tennis players, both male and female, towards WADA and the ITIA and the whole process.\\"  Australian player Nick Kyrgios also commented on the situation via X, stating he received messages from \\"multiple players\\" about how \\"putrid this is.\\"  An ITIA spokesperson told CNN that each case is handled the same way regardless of ranking or status, and that they actively encourage players to contact them with concerns.  WADA, in a statement to CNN, expressed satisfaction with the outcome, stating that \\"justice has been delivered\\" and that the sanction was appropriate.\\n\\n\\n**CONCLUSION**:\\n\\nMultiple high-profile tennis players have publicly expressed concerns regarding inconsistencies and perceived favoritism within the tennis anti-doping system, citing several recent cases as evidence.  While the ITIA and WADA maintain that each case is handled according to the facts and evidence, the differing outcomes and timing of sanctions have led to a lack of trust among players.\\n"}\r\n\r\n'

2025-02-19 22:57:51,962 [DEBUG] chunk: b'event: summary\r\ndata: {"type": "chunk", "content": "**SUMMARY**:\\n\\nNovak Djokovic, a 24-time Grand Slam singles champion, criticized the handling of recent doping cases in tennis, suggesting \\"favoritism\\" and stating that the situation is \\"not a good image for our sport.\\"  His comments follow the three-month ban imposed on world No. 1 Jannik Sinner for twice testing positive for the banned substance Clostebol in March 2024.  Initially, the International Tennis Integrity Agency (ITIA) cleared Sinner in August 2024, but the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) appealed, leading to the CAS ruling resulting in the ban.  The ban, effective February 9 to May 4, 2025, will not affect Sinner\'s participation in the French Open, according to reports.  Djokovic stated that a majority of players he\'s spoken to feel the process was unfair and that \\"there is favoritism happening,\\" adding that \\"it appears that you can almost affect the outcome if you are a top player, if you have access to the top lawyers and whatnot.\\"\\n\\nBritish tennis player Liam Broady echoed these concerns, stating to BBC Sport that the ban seemed designed to \\"impact Jannik\\u2019s career as little as possible,\\" noting the timing of the ban ending just before the Rome Masters, a major tournament in Sinner\'s home country.  Sinner himself stated that the positive tests resulted from \\"inadvertent contamination of Clostebol\\" through a physiotherapist\'s use of an over-the-counter spray.  Despite the initial clearance, Sinner subsequently won the 2024 US Open and the 2025 Australian Open.\\n\\nThe handling of Sinner\'s case, along with that of women\'s world No. 2 Iga \\u015awi\\u0105tek (who received a one-month suspension for trimetazidine), has drawn criticism.  Two-time Grand Slam champion Simona Halep, who received a four-year ban (later reduced to nine months by CAS) for Roxadustat, also criticized the differing treatment.  The ITIA responded to Halep\'s accusations by stating that it \\"deal(s) with each case based on the facts and evidence, not a player\\u2019s name, ranking or nationality.\\"  Halep subsequently retired from professional tennis.\\n\\nDjokovic further emphasized the need to address the system\'s inconsistencies, stating on Monday, \\"The inconsistency is something that frustrates all the players...Right now, there is a lack of trust generally from tennis players, both male and female, towards WADA and the ITIA and the whole process.\\"  Australian player Nick Kyrgios also commented on the situation via X, stating he received messages from \\"multiple players\\" about how \\"putrid this is.\\"  An ITIA spokesperson told CNN that each case is handled the same way regardless of ranking or status, and that they actively encourage players to contact them with concerns.  WADA, in a statement to CNN, expressed satisfaction with the outcome, stating that \\"justice has been delivered\\" and that the sanction was appropriate.\\n\\n\\n**CONCLUSION**:\\n\\nMultiple high-profile tennis players have publicly expressed concerns regarding inconsistencies and perceived favoritism within the tennis anti-doping system, citing several recent cases as evidence.  While the ITIA and WADA maintain that each case is handled according to the facts and evidence, the differing outcomes and timing of sanctions have led to a lack of trust among players.\\n"}\r\n\r\n'

The 2024 NFL season is officially in the rearview mirror, and 31 teams around the league will spend the next seven months trying to improve their rosters to compete with the Super Bowl champion Philadelphia Eagles, while the Eagles themselves will try to maintain their position as the best roster in football.

Russell Wilson/Justin FieldsQBSteelers Higgins is expected to be franchise tagged for a second straight year, technically taking him off the open market, but we've seen before that franchise-tagged players are gettable if you're willing to offer enough draft capital and an appropriate contract. If the Bengals won't pay him what he's worth, then there will be some team willing to meet the price on both fronts -- and in that case, he remains the top available player. Higgins is expected to be franchise tagged for a second straight year, technically taking him off the open market, but we've seen before that franchise-tagged players are gettable if you're willing to offer enough draft capital and an appropriate contract. If the Bengals won't pay him what he's worth, then there will be some team willing to meet the price on both fronts -- and in that case, he remains the top available player. Smith is pretty clearly the next-best available player, and he's almost surely going to be playing for a new team next season due to Kansas City's cap situation. Any team looking for an interior lineman should be looking his way first. There are other players available at the position, though, with a bunch of depth at guard in particular: Fries, Zeitler, Becton, Jenkins, Martin, Daniels and Scherff are all quality starters. Some of them have age (Zeitler, Martin, Scherff) or injury (Becton, Martin) issues that could hold them back from being their best selves, but there is a lot of depth among the group either way.

The same is true of receiver, by the way. Godwin and Diggs are each coming off significant knee injuries, but both showed this season that they can still play at a high level. There's less risk in Godwin because he's younger, but Diggs might cost less due to the age/injury combination. Even beyond those two players, though, there is a lot of depth on the receiver market.

There's less risk in Godwin because he's younger, but Diggs might cost less due to the age/injury combination. Even beyond those two players, though, there is a lot of depth on the receiver market. Both Chiefs wideouts are available this offseason, and it might not cost that much to get them considering their own age (Hopkins) and injury (Brown) issues. Hollywood could be a really good buy low for somebody in the same way he made for a smart bet for the Chiefs this past year, only to have the dice roll come up snake eyes due to his preseason shoulder injury. Cooper didn't make much of an impact upon his arrival in Buffalo and that might drive his price down, but he was terrific in Cleveland the last couple years and had a personal issue derail some of his time with the Bills, which at least partially explains the drop in playing time and production. Then there's Allen, who is clearly not the same physically as he once was, but can still be a reliable underneath target in the slot. You'll want to limit his playing time and make sure he's not your top option in the passing game, but he can help.

Harris and Jones can still be part of backfield rotations, and players like Rico Dowdle and J.K. Dobbins will also be out there. Raheem Mostert was just released and will be available as well, and some team might want to take a shot on trying to recapture what Javonte Williams was early in his rookie contract, before his injury.

Raheem Mostert was just released and will be available as well, and some team might want to take a shot on trying to recapture what Javonte Williams was early in his rookie contract, before his injury. The quarterback class is ... not great. Darnold may have cost himself a significant amount of money with his performances in Week 18 and the first round of the playoffs, but he is still the top option out there. He may not get a long-term deal anymore, though, and may now be viewed as more of a mid-tier bridge quarterback than surefire starter. After him, you can take your pick of Steelers quarterbacks. There's not much upside in Wilson anymore so Fields seems like the better bet to me, but the league might not see it that way. If you miss out on those guys, there's always young players like Trey Lance, Mac Jones and Zach Wilson, or long-term backups like Jacoby Brissett and Marcus Mariota. Or hey, someone might take another shot on Jimmy Garoppolo. The quarterback class is ... not great.
