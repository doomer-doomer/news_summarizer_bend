We know this because paleontologists have just made a startling find: a nearly complete skull from this newly discovered hypercarnivore. It belonged to a member of the extinct order of carnivores known as Hyaenodonta.

A team led by paleontologist Shorouq Al-Ashqar of Mansoura University and the American University in Egypt has given the fearsome creature the name Bastetodon syrtos, after the Egyptian lioness-headed goddess of protection, Bastet. "For days, the team meticulously excavated layers of rock dating back around 30 million years," Al-Ashqar recalls of the dig that yielded the fossilized skull bones.

"Just as we were about to conclude our work, a team member spotted something remarkable – a set of large teeth sticking out of the ground.

His excited shout brought the team together, marking the beginning of an extraordinary discovery: a nearly complete skull of an ancient apex carnivore, a dream for any vertebrate paleontologist." The Fayum Depression, where the bones were found, represents an incredibly rich and important fossil assemblage for understanding a 15 million-year period in the history of the region, during the Paleogene, a crucial time in the rise of mammals. The Fayum Depression, where the bones were found, represents an incredibly rich and important fossil assemblage for understanding a 15 million-year period in the history of the region, during the Paleogene, a crucial time in the rise of mammals. Paleontologists have been working in the region for more than a century, uncovering the rich ecosystem that once thrived there. Paleontologists have been working in the region for more than a century, uncovering the rich ecosystem that once thrived there. "The Fayum is one of the most important fossil areas in Africa," explains paleontologist Matt Borths of Duke University in the US. "Without it, we would know very little about the origins of African ecosystems and the evolution of African mammals like elephants, primates, and hyaenodonts."

"Without it, we would know very little about the origins of African ecosystems and the evolution of African mammals like elephants, primates, and hyaenodonts." Although all bones are important for understanding the anatomy of extinct beasts, the skull is arguably the most important, revealing much about an animal\'s survival strategies. The skull of Bastetodon reveals dentition consistent with Hyaeonodonta, allowing its confident classification, as well as insights into its lifestyle.

The skull of Bastetodon reveals dentition consistent with Hyaeonodonta, allowing its confident classification, as well as insights into its lifestyle. The animal, the researchers say, was a hypercarnivore – one whose diet, much like cats (wild ones, at any rate) and crocodiles, consists of more than 70 percent meat. It would have occupied a top predator position in its local food web. The animal, the researchers say, was a hypercarnivore – one whose diet, much like cats (wild ones, at any rate) and crocodiles, consists of more than 70 percent meat. It would have occupied a top predator position in its local food web. But the discovery allowed something else – the contextualization of fossils discovered 120 years ago. These remains belonged to a group of lion-sized hyaenodonts that lived in the Fayum region millions of years ago. When they were first analyzed in 1904, they were lumped in with European hyaenodonts.

Al-Ashqar and her colleagues found that these fossils, newly grouped together under the genus Sekhmetops (for the Ancient Egyptian lioness-headed goddess of war, Sekhmet) originated in Africa in waves, and are distinct from the European hyaenodonts. Bastetodon also originated in Africa.

Bastetodon also originated in Africa. From there, the animals spread across the Northern hemisphere, making their way to Asia, Europe, India, and North America. However, their reign in Africa was curtailed by environmental changes that led to their eventual extinction, opening ecological niches for other predators to rise to prominence.

The discovery occurred during an excavation of rock layers dating back approximately 30 million years.  Al-Ashqar recounts,  \\u201cFor days, the team meticulously excavated layers of rock dating back around 30 million years...Just as we were about to conclude our work, a team member spotted something remarkable \\u2013 a set of large teeth sticking out of the ground. His excited shout brought the team together, marking the beginning of an extraordinary discovery: a nearly complete skull of an ancient apex carnivore, a dream for any vertebrate paleontologist.\\u201d\\n\\nThe newly discovered species, named *Bastetodon syrtos*, belonged to the extinct order Hyaenodonta and was a leopard-sized apex predator.  Its skull reveals dentition consistent with the Hyaenodonta order, providing insights into its lifestyle.  According to the researchers, *Bastetodon syrtos* was a hypercarnivore, with a diet consisting of more than 70 percent meat.  It occupied a top predator position within its ecosystem.\\n\\nThe Fayum Depression, where the fossil was found, is described by paleontologist Matt Borths of Duke University as \\u201cone of the most important fossil areas in Africa,\\u201d crucial for understanding the origins of African ecosystems and the evolution of African mammals.  The discovery also provided context for fossils found 120 years ago, which were initially misclassified. These fossils, now grouped under the genus *Sekhmetops*, are now understood to have originated in Africa and spread across the Northern Hemisphere to Asia, Europe, India, and North America before their eventual extinction due to environmental changes.\\n\\nAl-Ashqar states, \\"The discovery of *Bastetodon* is a significant achievement in understanding the diversity and evolution of hyaenodonts and their global distribution. We are eager to continue our research to unravel the intricate relationships between these ancient predators and their environments over time and across continents.\\u201d The research has been published in the *Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology*.\\n\\n\\n**CONCLUSION**:\\n\\nThe discovery of the nearly complete skull of *Bastetodon syrtos* in the Fayum Depression represents a significant contribution to our understanding of ancient African ecosystems and the evolution of the extinct Hyaenodonta order.  The find not only reveals a new apex predator species but also clarifies the evolutionary history and geographic distribution of related species previously misidentified.  Further research is planned to explore the relationships between these ancient predators and their environment.\\n"}\r\n\r\n'

Former Southwest spokesperson Ed Stewart highlighted the significance of the layoffs, stating, \\"For more than 50 years we had that claim to fame...it...was always people first,\\" adding, \\"That\\u2019s why it\\u2019s such a big shock right now in the industry.\\"\\n\\nWill Anderson, Editor in Chief of the Dallas Business Journal, pointed out that CEO Bob Jordan aims for $500 million in annual savings, suggesting these layoffs may not be the final cost-cutting measure.  He stated, \\"CEO Bob Jordan has said he wants to save about $500 million annually...So, this gets him part way there, but not all the way.\\"\\n\\nDallas Mayor Eric Johnson offered a statement in response to the layoffs: \\u201cI do not comment on individual business decisions, but my heart goes out to the employees who are losing jobs and to all those impacted by this period of transition. Southwest Airlines has become a dynamic and dominant airline because its leaders have made bold decisions, adapted to changing economic conditions, prioritized customer service, and provided an affordable and competitive option for travelers, including those who fly out of Dallas Love Field. We remain proud that Southwest calls Dallas home.\\u201d\\n\\n\\n**CONCLUSION**:\\n\\nSouthwest Airlines implemented its first-ever mass layoff, affecting 1,750 corporate employees in Dallas, as part of a cost-cutting initiative aiming for $500 million in annual savings.  The layoffs, while unprecedented in the company\'s 53-year history, are presented by leadership as necessary for restructuring and transforming the airline into a \\"leaner, faster, and more agile organization.\\"  The impact on the Dallas community and the airline\'s future remain to be seen.\\n"}\r\n\r\n'

The injury appeared to occur at 5:12 of the first period when Tkachuk lost his edge on a rush, crashing into Swedish goalie Samuel Ersson's leg and skate, dislodging the net.  After a brief return to the ice for a 10-second and then a 14-second shift, Tkachuk did not play for the remainder of the game.\n\nU.S. coach Mike Sullivan stated, “Brady obviously had a lower-body injury.

I haven't got an update to this point after the game yet, so we'll see how he responds, but I don't anticipate it being an issue.”  The team was already playing without Matthew Tkachuk (lower body), Auston Matthews (upper body), and Charlie McAvoy (upper body).  Sullivan commented on the other injured players, saying, “Charlie, right now he's out with an upper-body injury.
